I am a PhD candidate with the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) and a research fellow at the [Chair of Comparative Behavior](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/tim-wappenhans) at Humboldt University, Berlin.
 
I use experiments and large-scale datasets to understand

- This
- That


I hold a Masters in Social Sciences (2020) from Humboldt University.

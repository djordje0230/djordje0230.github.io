I am a PhD candidate with the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) and a research fellow at the [Chair of Comparative Behavior](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/tim-wappenhans) at Humboldt University, Berlin.

My research is focused on political behavior and comparative politics. I am interested in voters and responsiveness of political actors. I use both causal identification strategies for observational data and experiments for my research.

I hold a Masters in Social Sciences (2020) from Humboldt University.

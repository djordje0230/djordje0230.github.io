I am a PhD candidate with the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) and a research fellow at the [Chair of Comparative Behavior](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/tim-wappenhans) at Humboldt University, Berlin.
 
In my PhD projects, I use experiments and original data to understand how large scale shifts like demographic and climate change shape political polarization.

I am a PhD candidate with the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) and a research fellow at the [Chair of Comparative Behavior](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/tim-wappenhans) at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.

My research is focused on political behavior and comparative politics. I am interested in voter behavior and responsiveness of political actors. I use both causal identification strategies for observational data and experimental data for my research.

In my dissertation, which is supervised by [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com), I analyze the causes and consequences of affective polarization in Western Europe.

I completed my pre-doctoral studies at the Humboldt-Universität, spent a semester at the [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/) in Portland, Oregon and have a background in ethnography.

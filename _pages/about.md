# This page is currently under construction 🏗️

I am a research fellow at [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/lehrbereiche-en/comparative-political-behavior/team/tim-wappenhans) and a PhD candidate at the [DYNAMICS Research Training Group](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics) which is jointly organized by Humboldt-Universität and the Hertie School of Governance.

I am interested in political behavior and comparative politics. I focus on the the behavior of voters and responsiveness of political actors in the face of changing demographic pressures. I use both causal identification strategies for observational data and experimental data for my reserach.

In my dissertation, which is supervised by [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com), I analyze the causes and consequences of affective polarization in multiparty systems.

I completed my pre-doctoral studies at the Humboldt-Universität, spent a semester at the [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/) in Portland, Oregon and have a background in ethnography.
